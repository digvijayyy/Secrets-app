A basic web app which facilitates the user to submit their secrets with complete anonymity once registered to the website, however one can view the secrets submitted by other anonymous users without registering.
The user is allowed to login either locally or via third party apps such as google and facebook, which is implemented using passport.js (OAuth 2.0 authentication strategy). By plugging into Passport, Google or facebook authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework. A session is maintained which allows the user to access certain priviledged components of the app without having the need to tap into their account once they are authenticated, this feature is also taken care of by functionality of passport.js
